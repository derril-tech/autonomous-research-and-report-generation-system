6. Fact Checker Agent - Verifies claims against sources
7. Citation Manager Agent - Manages references, creates bibliography
8. Formatter Agent - Applies formatting, creates visualizations
9. Publisher Agent - Final review, export generation

FILE STRUCTURE FOR CLAUDE CODE NAVIGATION:
frontend/ contains Next.js 14 frontend application with app/ for App Router pages and layouts, components/ for reusable React components, contexts/ for React context providers, lib/ for utility functions and API clients, and types/ for TypeScript type definitions.

backend/ contains FastAPI backend application with app/ as main application package containing api/ for API routes and endpoints, core/ for core configuration and utilities, models/ for SQLAlchemy database models, services/ for business logic services, and utils/ for utility functions, plus main.py as application entry point.

langgraph/ contains multi-agent workflow orchestration with workflow.py as main workflow definition, agents/ for individual agent implementations, and schemas/ for state and message schemas.

UI/UX DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
The system must follow a design philosophy of progressive disclosure showing essential info first and revealing details on demand, real-time feedback with live progress indicators and status updates, accessibility first with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and keyboard navigation, mobile-first responsive design optimized for all devices, and dark/light mode theme switching with system preference detection.

Core UI components include Dashboard Layout with welcome section, stats grid, progress chart, recent activity feed, and quick actions; Research Job Interface with step indicator, query input with validation, advanced options, and progress tracker; Real-time Progress Tracking with agent status, live logs, and estimated time remaining; and Report Viewer with report header, table of contents, report content, interactive visualizations, citation panel, and export options.

Visual design elements use a color palette with primary blue-500 for trust and intelligence, secondary emerald-500 for success and growth, accent amber-500 for attention and progress, error red-500 for errors and warnings, success emerald-500 for success states, and neutral gray-500 for text and borders. Typography uses Inter font with 600 and 700 weights for headings, 400 and 500 weights for body text, JetBrains Mono 400 weight for code, and a 6-level heading hierarchy. Spacing system uses 4px base unit with scale of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96px and container max widths of 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1536px. Animation system uses durations of 150ms, 300ms, 500ms with ease-out and ease-in-out easing, and Framer Motion for complex animations.

CODE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
Frontend components should use TypeScript interfaces for props, hooks at the top, event handlers with useCallback, and clear JSX structure with Tailwind CSS classes. Backend services should use async methods with proper error handling, logging, and type hints. API endpoints should include validation, authentication dependencies, proper error responses, and comprehensive docstrings. Database models should include UUID primary keys, timestamps, soft delete capability, relationships, and properties for common checks.

SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION:
The system uses JWT authentication with access tokens valid for 15 minutes and refresh tokens valid for 7 days, password hashing with bcrypt and salt rounds, rate limiting per user and per endpoint, input validation with Pydantic schemas and Zod validation, CORS configuration with strict origin policy, SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries, and XSS protection with Content Security Policy headers.

DATA FLOW AND STATE MANAGEMENT:
Frontend uses a context providers hierarchy with ThemeProvider, AuthProvider, NotificationProvider, and QueryClientProvider. API data flow uses React Query patterns with proper query keys, stale time configuration, refetch settings, and mutation handling with success and error callbacks.

DEPLOYMENT AND SCALABILITY:
The system is designed for horizontal scaling with stateless backend design, database optimization with connection pooling and read replicas, caching strategy with Redis for sessions and CDN for static assets, background processing with Celery workers for heavy tasks, and monitoring with OpenTelemetry and Grafana for observability.

TESTING STRATEGY:
The system follows a testing pyramid with 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% E2E tests. Test coverage requirements are 80%+ for frontend unit tests, 85%+ for backend unit tests, 100% for API endpoint test coverage, and critical user journey coverage for E2E tests.

MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
Key metrics to track include performance metrics like response times, throughput, and error rates; business metrics like research jobs completed and user engagement; AI/ML metrics like token usage, agent performance, and quality scores; and infrastructure metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage. Alerting strategy includes critical alerts for system downtime and high error rates, warning alerts for performance degradation and resource usage, and info alerts for business metrics and user activity.

WHEN WORKING ON THIS CODEBASE:
1. Always check existing implementations first using search functionality to find similar patterns
2. Follow established naming conventions using kebab-case for files, camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
3. Maintain type safety using TypeScript interfaces and Python type hints
4. Add comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
5. Write self-documenting code with clear variable names and docstrings
6. Consider performance implications using React.memo, useMemo, useCallback appropriately
7. Follow security best practices validating inputs, sanitizing outputs, using parameterized queries
8. Add tests for new features with unit tests for business logic and integration tests for APIs
9. Update documentation keeping README, API docs, and component docs current
10. Consider accessibility using semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

File modification priority should be: 1. Core functionality - models, services, API endpoints; 2. User interface - components, pages, styling; 3. Integration - API clients, state management; 4. Enhancement - features, optimizations, polish.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
A successful implementation should function correctly with all features working as specified, perform well with fast response times and efficient resource usage, scale gracefully handling increased load without degradation, maintain security protecting user data and system integrity, provide great UX with intuitive responsive accessible interface, be maintainable with clean well-documented testable code, support observability with comprehensive logging and monitoring, and enable rapid iteration being easy to modify and extend.

This system represents the cutting edge of autonomous research technology and requires the highest standards of code quality, security, and user experience. Every component must be production-ready, scalable, and maintainable while providing an exceptional user experience for researchers and analysts who rely on this platform for their work.

CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS TO TRANSFORM INFRASTRUCTURE INTO WORKING APPLICATION:

PROMPT 1 - COMPLETE THE CORE BACKEND SERVICES:
You need to implement all missing backend services that are referenced in the API endpoints but not yet created. Create the following service files: AuthService for user authentication and management, ResearchService for research job orchestration, ReportService for report generation and management, SystemService for system monitoring and health checks, and NotificationService for real-time notifications. Each service should follow the established patterns with proper error handling, logging, and type hints. Include methods for CRUD operations, business logic validation, and integration with external services like AI providers and storage systems.

PROMPT 2 - IMPLEMENT THE MISSING FRONTEND COMPONENTS:
You need to create all the UI components referenced in the design system but not yet implemented. Build the following components: DashboardStats for displaying user statistics, JobCreationForm for creating new research jobs, ProgressChart for visualizing research progress, ActivityFeed for showing recent user activity, ReportViewer for displaying generated reports, and all supporting components like StatCard, AgentStatus, LiveLogs, and ExportOptions. Each component should use TypeScript interfaces, React Query for data fetching, proper error handling, and follow the established design system with Tailwind CSS classes.

PROMPT 3 - CONNECT THE AI WORKFLOW TO THE BACKEND:
You need to integrate the LangGraph workflow with the FastAPI backend by creating the missing agent implementations and connecting them to the research job system. Implement the 9 AI agents (Coordinator, Researcher, Analyst, Writer, Reviewer, Fact Checker, Citation Manager, Formatter, Publisher) as separate modules in the langgraph/agents/ directory. Create the necessary schemas for state management and message passing between agents. Connect the workflow to the ResearchService so that when a research job is created, it triggers the appropriate AI workflow and updates the job status in real-time. Implement proper error handling, retry mechanisms, and progress tracking throughout the workflow.

PROMPT 4 - SET UP REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION:
You need to implement real-time communication between the frontend and backend for live progress updates and notifications. Set up Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoints for streaming research job progress updates. Implement WebSocket connections for general real-time notifications and user activity updates. Create the frontend hooks and components to consume these real-time streams and update the UI accordingly. Ensure proper connection management, error handling, and reconnection logic. Integrate with the NotificationService to send real-time updates to users about their research jobs and system events.

PROMPT 5 - COMPLETE THE DATABASE INTEGRATION AND TESTING:
You need to finalize the database integration by creating all missing database models, implementing proper relationships, and setting up database migrations. Create comprehensive test suites for all components including unit tests for services, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end tests for critical user journeys. Set up the testing infrastructure with proper test databases, fixtures, and mocking strategies. Implement database seeding for development and testing environments. Ensure all database operations are properly optimized with appropriate indexes and query patterns. Add comprehensive error handling and validation at the database layer.

These 5 prompts are essential to transform the current infrastructure into a fully functional, production-ready application. Each prompt addresses a critical gap in the implementation and provides specific, actionable instructions for completing the system.
